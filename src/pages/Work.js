          I've had the pleasure of working with Malena for 7+ years. Many of
          those years were as peers at a board level. Malena is thoughtful, hard
          working, and thorough. She is also a talented designer with a fine
          attention to detail. -{" "}

          Malena is exceptionally talented and dedicated developer, eager and
          able to tackle hard challenges and pick up new skills on the fly. She
          cares deeply about her code and her craft and can always be counted on
          her document and share her solutions with the rest of the team.
          Working in a virtual team she clearly showed she treats work as
          something much greater than a job, and that's a gift to any team. -

          I've worked with Malena for years as both as a designer and a
          developer for web and web mobile projects. She always brings an
          original perspective to each project she works on. She excels at
          client collaboration and bringing stakeholders into the design
          process. -{" "}
